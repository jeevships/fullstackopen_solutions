# Full Stack Open 2025

This repository contains my projects and solutions for the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/) course from the University of Helsinki.

The course covers many topics of full stack web development such as:

* React
* Redux
* Node.js
* Express
* REST APIs
* GraphQL
* MongoDB
* Relational Databases
* TypeScript
* React Native
* Unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing
* CI/CD

The course was estimated to take about 20 hours per part to complete. However, to maximize my learning potential I'm generally spending anywhere from 25 to 40 hours per part. I find this extra time to be very beneficial.
